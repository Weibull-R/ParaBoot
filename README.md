ParaBoot
========

 

Parametric bootstrap bounds for Weibull and Lognormal models.

 

This is a development package housing replacement code for WeibullR that will
permit confidence interval bounds preparation with 3 parameters.  This package
has dependency on WeibullR, but does not override any WeibullR functionality.
