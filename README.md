Parametric bootstrap bounds for Weibull and Lognormal models.

 

Parametric bootstrapping has also been referenced as pivotal analysis. Robert
Abernethy promoted the pivotal bounds based on median rank regression models in
his "The New Weibull Handbook". Abernethy also invested much effort in
establishing a goodness of fit measure on the basis of the percent of r and
r-squared, prr, derived from the pivotal analysis.

Pivotal analysis has also been discussed in Jerome Lawless’ book “ “. The
analysis he describes is based on maximum likelihood estimation models and is
perhaps the most foundational writing on the topic.

 

### Complete Failure Data, Weibull Sampling

In the simplest case a pivotal analysis is demonstrated in code for data
containing 20 complete failure points. It is expected that one would produce a
pivotal analysis sampling on Weibull parameters of Beta = 1 and Eta = 1.  In the
example script complete2p.r only 20 samples are drawn to make the plot sensible,
but this is not enough to represent the full spectrum generated by say 10,000
samples; the default used in WeibullR.

As the parametric bootstrap is carried out the quantiles for each fitted sample
at designated descriptive percentiles are accumulated as rows in a matrix. When
each percentile column is sorted the rows describe confidence bounds.
Importantly with complete failure samples the median line defines a unity where
Eta and Beta \~= 1. I will refer to this as the unity bootstrap for rest of this
discussion.

For any example data for which confidence bounds are to be formed it is possible
to take the unity bootstrap and translate for given log(Eta), then rotate, with
y as `log(log(1/(1-unreliabiilty)`, for given Beta. Rotation is centered at the
63.2% “characteristic life” point `pweibull(1,1,1)`.
